			My name is Will Dolan, I'm a sophomore studying Economics and Computer Science at Tufts University.
		</p>

		<p>
			I was born in a town called Milton, the first town south of Boston. However, when I was 12, I moved to San Francisco with my mom, stepdad, and sister. It was an incredibly formative time in my life to pack up and move to a completely different place and lifestyle, and I'm grateful every day for the unique sense of perspective which I think has been afforded to me.

		<p>
			My interests now include rugby, listening to weird records, creating art, and reading good books. I've lately gotten into web design and development, too, which has incorporated some photography and design skills I picked up in high school.
		</p>

			Some miscellaneous cool stuff: last summer, I went gold mining in Northern California and worked backstage security at a music festival. I also drove from San Francisco to Boston, a 4200 mile trip that took 10 days.I'm planning on going backpacking through Chile in May, and to Mexico in March.

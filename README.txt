Comp20 Assignment 1 Readme

This is the read me for the first Comp20 Assignment. Included in this repository are three HTML files: a resume, a short autobiography, and an index file which should be the default webpage.  The three HTML files all link to one of two CSS files, home.css and resume.css.  The resume.css file was originally intended to just serve as the styling for the resume, but the bio.html also links to it, albeit only for the font declaration in the p{} rule. index.html links to the home.css file. All files have been correctly implemented, and I worked alone on this for about 2 hours.}
